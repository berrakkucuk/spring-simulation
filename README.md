# spring-simulation
simulation of objects attached to a spring, calculation of their kinetic and potential energy \newline

spring.py -- two objects start to move from both sides of the spring \newline
spring2.py -- only one object starts to move, by dropping from a hight, existing potential energy \newline
spring3.py -- only one object starts to move with a force from outside of the system \newline
